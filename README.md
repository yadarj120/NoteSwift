## Functionality

When the extension gets installed, user needs to use his/her google account to sign in.

Whenever you press H on the keyboard, the current youtube videos gets paused and the screenshot of current window gets pasted in a google doc,
a popup appears where use can enter any additional note with the screenshot

If the doc did not exist before, for the current video it gets created

If the video is part of a playlist then a single doc is maintained for the all the videos in the playlist

`This version of the extension is only made for Youtube`
